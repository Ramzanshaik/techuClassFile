        <h1>LETS START WITH OUR STORY</h1><br>
        <P>8 years ago in 2016, most of you might not know that inFeedo almost shut
            down. Now who'd have thought, that soon in 2016, we'd give birth/pivot to
            Amber, win India's shark tank, make it to Y Combinator, raise $16M, do
            2 ESOP buybacks and most importantly make an impact in the lives of
            1.7M+ employees across 75 countries. 
           <P><br></P> We're grateful to our incredible team of inFolks for making this happen and
            it remains priority 1 for us to continue surrounding ourselves with A
            players driven by curiosity. inFeedo is not for everyone, so if you're a light-
            hearted one, do give a listen to our founder's brutally honest podcast titled
            The one where 2020 was hell until YC", so you know what you're walking
            into <br><br><br>
            Our mission: Make the voice of 10 million employees heard & valued. Help
            enterprises build cultures where people to come to work
            into </p></P>
